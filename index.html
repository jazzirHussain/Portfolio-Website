            <h6>My name is Jazzir Hussain. I am a young, enthusiastic web developer. Currently I am 18 years old.
                 Yes, by hearing that you would be thinking, "how can he be a software developer at this very young age?". 
                 But fortunately by the grace of GOD and with the blessings of my parents I built this website from scratch.
                 Along with this I have completed other two projcts for a Plywood Manufacturing Unit.<br><br>I learned to code by watching tutorials in Youtube and other learning platforms.
                 At the beginning everything was like a puzzle,I didn't know where to start?, which all languages I need to study? But with the help of my Uncle and some good friends 
                 I figured it out. Slowly everything started to seem perfect. On my way I learnt: <li>Python</li><li>HTML</li><li>CSS</li><li>JavaScript</li><li>JQuery</li>
                 and some basics in  <li>Problem Solving</li><li>Data Structures and Algorithms</li></h6>
